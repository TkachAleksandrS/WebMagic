1. Load data about articles from https://laravel-news.com/blog with tag 'news' for the last 4 months
2. Show loaded data on the main page as a table with the next fields:
    * publication date in a format - 'd.m.Y'
    * title as a link to the article page
    * author name
    * all tags associated with article separated by a comma
3. Articles should be sorted alphabetically by author name
4. A possibility of manual sorting by title and date should be available also
5. Articles should be loaded once and saved in DB
6. Every page reload should show data from DB
7. Additionally add a command for updating the articles' data
8. The project should be built using docker containers

#### Requirements
